# Creator Operating Rhythm

Consistency is not about posting daily. It's about protecting the **right energy for the right task**. Here's the weekly cadence we coach inside Panda Growth.

<Metric label="Consistency" value="12-week streak" />

## 01. Monday — Intake & Insights

- Curate high-signal threads, replies, community questions.
- Tag insights as **Problem / Proof / Prompt**.
- Score ideas with a simple ICE: Impact, Confidence, Ease.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Spend 60 minutes on “inbox zero for research”. It keeps the content backlog healthy.
</Callout>

## 02. Wednesday — Draft & Review

<Step step={1} title="Outline">
  Turn chosen idea into bullet structure. Define hook, turns, CTA.
</Step>
<Step step={2} title="Draft">
  Write first draft in 25-minute focus blocks. No editing.
</Step>
<Step step={3} title="Pair Review">
  Share with accountability partner. Use the 3-question rubric: clarity, proof, action.
</Step>

## 03. Friday — Publish & Retro

<Checklist>
  <ChecklistItem>Schedule threads & replies (use queue tools or manual).</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Log analytics snapshot after 12/48 hours.</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Run mini retro: what to amplify, what to cut.</ChecklistItem>
</Checklist>

<Callout variant="warning" title="Mindset">
  Analytics can trigger anxiety. We separate data review from drafting days to protect creative flow.
</Callout>

## 04. Monthly Pulse

- Invite community feedback (AMA, office hours).
- Update growth experiment board.
- Celebrate wins with screenshots & testimonials → fuels social proof.

Keep the rhythm, and your audience will feel the professionalism behind every post.
