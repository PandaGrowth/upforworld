tldr:
  - Threads need modular blocks to stay readable.
  - Hooks work when they set tension and promise payoff.
  - Use rhythm markers so readers never feel lost.
checklist:
  - Define the Promise, Journey, and Reward before drafting.
  - Limit each block to one idea + one proof.
  - Insert Open Loops every 3-4 tweets.

# Thread Architecture Kit

I've deconstructed 140+ high-performing threads. The winners are not the most insightful—they're the easiest to **follow**. This kit gives you the scaffolding.

<Metric label="Avg retention" value="68% → 87%" />

## 01. Three Core Blocks

1. **Promise** — Hook + payoff preview  
2. **Journey** — Modular proof blocks  
3. **Reward** — CTA + takeaway loop

<Callout variant="tip" title="Design for Skimmers">
  Each block should be readable standalone. Readers skim until a line
  hooks them; make sure every start line is compelling.
</Callout>

## 02. Building Blocks

<Step step={1} title="Promise Block">
  Pair tension (“Everyone does X”) with contrast (“We tried Y
  instead”). State the transformation and timeline explicitly.
</Step>

<Step step={2} title="Journey Blocks">
  Use micro-headlines (“Step 1 — Audit inputs”) and add proof: data, quote, or screenshot. Keep each block to one idea.
</Step>

<Step step={3} title="Reward Block">
  Deliver the promised insight, then open two loops: a next step &
  a resource. CTA should map to the thread’s goal (DM, signup, follow).
</Step>

## 03. Rhythm Markers

Insert “beats” every few tweets:

<Checklist>
  <ChecklistItem>Tweet 1: Hook + promise</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Tweet 4: Loop opener (“But here’s the twist…”) </ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Tweet 7: Proof moment (data or story)</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Tweet 10: Reward + CTA</ChecklistItem>
</Checklist>

<Callout variant="warning" title="Avoid the wall of text">
  Threads fail when readers feel lost. Use whitespace, emoji bullets,
  and short sentences for pace.
</Callout>

## 04. Template

```
Tweet 1  — Hook + promise  
Tweet 2  — Context (why it matters)  
Tweet 3  — Roadmap (3 bullets)  
Tweets 4-9 — Journey blocks  
Tweet 10 — Reward + CTA
```

Apply this kit, test with analytics, and iterate. System beats inspiration.
