tldr:
  - Treat AI as a loop, not one-off edits.
  - Separate structure edits from polish.
  - Build a prompt library tied to metrics.
checklist:
  - Draft → Structure review → Voice polish → CTA alignment
  - Log AI edits and accept/reject rationale
  - Update prompt library monthly with winning variants

# AI Assisted Editing Loop

We love GPT but hate bland outputs. The fix: treat AI as a structured editing loop with checkpoints tied to analytics.

## 01. Four-phase Workflow

<Step step={1} title="Draft">
  Human-first draft focusing on story and data. No AI yet.
</Step>
<Step step={2} title="Structure Review">
  Use AI to check narrative flow: ask for missing context, unclear transitions, redundant points.
</Step>
<Step step={3} title="Voice Polish">
  Feed AI a style guide (tone, sentence length, emoji usage) and request changes inline.
</Step>
<Step step={4} title="CTA Alignment">
  Compare CTA with goal. Ask AI to propose 3 alternatives that match the funnel stage.
</Step>

## 02. Prompt Templates

<Callout title="Structure Checker Prompt">
  “Act as an editor. Highlight gaps that hurt retention. Suggest where to add proof or cut fluff.”
</Callout>

<Callout variant="tip" title="Voice Harmonizer">
  “Rewrite the paragraph using short sentences, one vivid verb, and an invitational tone. Keep jargon minimal.”
</Callout>

## 03. Logging Decisions

Track accepted vs. rejected suggestions.

<Checklist>
  <ChecklistItem>Accepted change? Note impact metric (e.g., saved 30% words).</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Rejected change? Record reason (keeps voice, protects nuance).</ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>Update prompt library monthly with learnings.</ChecklistItem>
</Checklist>

## 04. Metrics That Matter

- **Retention delta** after implementing structure edits  
- **Time saved** vs. manual editing  
- **CTA click uplift** after variant testing

<Metric label="平均节省时间" value="45 min" />

Keep the loop tight, and AI becomes an amplifier—not a crutch.
